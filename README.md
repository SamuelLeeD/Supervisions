# Supervisions
Game Theory answers are incomplete and I remember many of them being wrong, and there are minor mistakes in some of the other papers (I just don't remember which). Plus the lecturer for Uncertainty is different so the whole Micro folder is probably useless (except maybe Game Theory 4). Math answers may still be useful if the lecturers recycle questions (it looks pretty much identical to last year's with some rearrangements and omissions) and you can figure out which answers are for which questions

You should probably ignore answers for Signalling, I wasn't very serious with those

I never answered the essay questions very seriously either

Most of the answers are probably more verbose than they have to be

Some of the earlier supervisions are different from the ones in Moodle cause they were questions sent by Mr K
