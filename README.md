# Supervisions
These are my flawed answers for the 2018 Part IIA Economics supervision questions. I rarely did corrections back in year 2, and now I don't have time to look over all of them to see which I remember getting wrong, but you can e-mail me (CRSid sl839) to clarify answers and I may correct them if they're wrong.

To be clear, it doesn't matter to me what you do with these answers, except that you pass them along to anyone who might benefit.

Answers for core papers in order of confidence: Metrics (mostly correct with some minor mistakes) > Macro (answers are mostly going in the right direction) > Micro (fair bit of careless mistakes, be very critical of what you read)

Game Theory answers are incomplete and I remember many of them being wrong, and there are minor mistakes in some of the other papers (I just don't remember which). Plus the lecturer for Uncertainty is different so the whole Micro folder is probably useless (except maybe Game Theory 4).

Math answers may still be useful if the lecturers recycle questions (it looks pretty much identical to last year's with some rearrangements and omissions) and you can figure out which answers are for which questions. Stats 1 probably has many mistakes, especially the question about medians (no idea what I was thinking when I said you can prove necessity with a counterexample). Thing is I don't know for sure because they were never marked.

Michaelmas Labour questions are I think fine (though they were also never marked so I can't be sure). You should probably ignore answers for Signalling, I wasn't very serious with those, same with any essay questions

Most of the answers are probably more verbose than they have to be.

Some of the earlier supervisions are different from the ones in Moodle cause they were questions sent by my DoS.
