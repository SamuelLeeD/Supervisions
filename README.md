# Old supervision answers
These are my flawed answers for the 2018--2019 Part IIA and 2019--2020 Part IIB Economics supervision questions. I rarely did corrections, and now I don't have time to look over all of them to see which I remember getting wrong, but you can e-mail me (CRSid sl839) to clarify anything. Also,

- It was only in the middle of Part IIB when I had the idea to start saving the question papers, and some of the questions may have changed especially since many of the papers have different lecturers now
- If you see a file ending with "remarks" it's usually a scan of my answers with the supervisor's comments
- Most of the answers are probably more verbose than they have to be
- It doesn't matter to me what you do with these answers

# Part IIA
Some of the earlier supervisions are different from the ones in Moodle cause they were questions sent by my DoS.

Answers for core papers in order of confidence: Metrics (mostly correct with some minor mistakes) > Macro (answers are mostly going in the right direction) > Micro (fair bit of careless mistakes, be very critical of what you read)

Game Theory answers are incomplete and I remember many of them being wrong, and there are minor mistakes in some of the other papers (I just don't remember which). Plus the lecturer for Uncertainty is different so the whole Micro folder is probably useless (except maybe Game Theory 4).

Math answers may still be useful if the lecturers recycle questions (it looks pretty much identical to last year's with some rearrangements and omissions) and you can figure out which answers are for which questions. Stats 1 probably has many mistakes, especially the question about medians (no idea what I was thinking when I said you can prove necessity with a counterexample). Thing is I don't know for sure because they were never marked.

Michaelmas Labour questions are I think fine (though they were also never marked so I can't be sure). You should probably ignore answers for Signalling, I wasn't very serious with those, same with any essay questions

# Part IIB
This time I didn't have the heart to do a quick look so I'm just uploading most of them as-is, mistakes and all. Some supervisions are missing. In particular, I only have half the Paper 4 (Economic Theory) answers because I did it as an extra paper and never had any college supervisions (the PhD student in charge of the faculty supervisions was very kind to supervise me for the four sheets that are there). But in any case the Paper 4 syllabus has changed quite drastically, with Market Design and Networks in lieu of Matching and Behavioural (wish I had the new syllabus in my year).

The other option papers I did were Paper 7 (Public Economics) and Paper 10 (Econometrics), but I'm not including the answers for Paper 7 cause I didn't put the most effort into them and I think my answers are not good. Anyway those are mostly essays and Dr. Brendon's slides and explanations are very good, so the bulk of your answers will come from understanding the lectures anyway.

My answer on signal extraction for the sheet titled "Topics 3" differs slightly from what the lecturer would have put, and I included a little note at the end to say why.
